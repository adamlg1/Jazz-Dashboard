# Jazz-Dashboard
Final Project for Database Modeling Concepts

Sketch of initial thinking on my ERD and the data your project will be accessing and using (will replace this with an electronically made ERD diagram over the course of the project)

Sketch rough system design of your project, what are the technologies and pieces (shapes) and interactions (arrows) (this will also ideally be replaced over the course of the project)

## Goals for where I want my project to be at the following dates:
* 3/19 - Ugly website up, script scraping ESPN/Basketball Reference sort of working (at least grabs some data, not everything)
* 3/26 - Script to scrape for recent data works, and runs at a consistent time each day. User can view previous days of data as well.
* 4/2 - Prettying website, potentially have script pull the latest article on the Utah Jazz as well.
* 4/9 - Implement logging in, and store passwords securely through bcrypt and AWS dynamodb. 
* 4/16 - (hopefully have tested all along the way) Check all tests have a positive and negative case, load test, and fix security vulnerabilities.

Please include any additional relevant information you'd like to include or have. The website will be fairly simple as far as UX, but it will have the player's faces by the leading scorer and other stats for that day/week. I would like to store the stats historically, and hopefully be able to filter them by week. This will likely take going backwards and adding some data to test the website.
